encrypting.rkt - Runs in Racket

Encrypting program that encrypts/decrypts based on 3 different encrypting methods: 

1. "Décalage" which shifts to the right a string by an n number of characters.
2. "Permutation" which takes out multiple characters from 2 strings and concatenates them.
3. "Combiné": a combination of the above two.

A text to crypt/decrypt and an encrypting key are the inputs.
This code is commented in French.
